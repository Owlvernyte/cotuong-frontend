## üéì Overview

<p align="justify">
	Co Tuong is a traditional intellectual game played on a square board with pieces like General, Advisor, Horse, Chariot, Cannon, and Soldier. The goal is to checkmate the opponent's General by moving the pieces according to specific rules. This game requires strategy and prediction skills and is an integral part of entertainment culture in many countries. The objective of this project is to develop the game of Co Tuong on a Website platform, allowing online play and connectivity through the internet.
